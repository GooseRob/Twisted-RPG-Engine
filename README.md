# Twisted-RPG-Engine

A fully data‑driven, server‑authoritative RPG engine designed for modern web games.  
Built to empower creators with a flexible combat system, event runner, modular content, 
and MMO‑style social features — all without requiring coding knowledge.

## Features
- Turn‑based battle engine (PvP + PvE)
- Data‑driven skills, items, statuses, and elements
- Server‑authoritative combat resolution
- AI combatants
- Limit Break / Ultimate ability system
- Leveling, XP, and progression tables
- Status effects with formulas, durations, and modifiers
- Equipment system with stat bonuses and elemental affinities
- Event Runner integration (quests, triggers, conditions)
- MySQL‑backed content tables
- Socket.IO real‑time battle updates

## Goals
Twisted‑RPG‑Engine aims to be:
- **Extensible** — creators can add new skills, items, and classes without touching code
- **Safe** — server‑side validation prevents cheating
- **Accessible** — designed so non‑coders can build full RPG systems
- **Modular** — each subsystem can be replaced or expanded

## Status
Active development. Contributions welcome.
